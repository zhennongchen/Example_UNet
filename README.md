it is an example program to let you learn how to write a basic deep learning (DL) project.<br />

There are these components important in a DL project:
- your deep learning model 
- your data (patient list)
- data generator (how your model reads the file paths of your data)
- train / predict
These are all written in ```train.ipynb```, ```predict.ipynb``` and ```model/model.py```<br />

This simple project is a simple de-noising project (input: noisy data, output: clean data) with a 2D U-NET.
